Loose granules may be used instead of insulation quilt; this form of loft insulation can be blown into place and can be useful where access is difficult. The loft space must have adequate ventilation to prevent dampness; seek advice about this if unsure (particularly if installing insulation between rafters because a vapour control layer and ventilation above the insulation are required).
